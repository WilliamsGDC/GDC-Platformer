# GDC-Platformer

## What is this?
This is the repository which will hold the Unity project for our game. 

For now, head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/WilliamsGDC/GDC-Platformer/discussions) tab and suggest **features, mechanics, art styles, or any other ideas**! Click onto any topic and give your input. It doesn't have to be a fully formed thought, and you can also give feedback to other people's ideas.

When the core features have been decided, they will be added to the Projects tab and will be integrated by the Implementation Team.
