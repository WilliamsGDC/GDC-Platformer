# GDC-Platformer

## What is this?
This is the repository which will hold the Unity project for our game. 

For now, head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/WilliamsGDC/GDC-Platformer/discussions) tab and suggest **features, mechanics, art styles, or any other ideas**!

When the core features have been decided, they will be added to the Projects tab and will be integrated by the Implementation Team.
