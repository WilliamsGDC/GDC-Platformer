# GDC-Platformer

## What is this?
This is the repository which will hold the Unity project for our game. 

Head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/WilliamsGDC/GDC-Platformer/discussions) tab and suggest **features, mechanics, art styles, or any other ideas**!

## How to contribute code
### Setup
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) and sign in with your GitHub account
2. If you haven't yet received an invite from your email for the permissions to edit the code, write something in the Discussions tab and I will add you
3. Select "Clone a repository from the internet" and click WilliamsGDC/GDC-Platformer. This creates a local copy of the project for you to edit.
4. Press "Current branch: main" at the top of the screen and press "new branch." Name this branch your name or a general descriptor of what you are going to change (ex. "new-player-controller")
5. Open this folder in Unity Hub by pressing "Add" > "Add project from disk"

### Add changes
6. Press "Fetch Origin" **IMPORTANT: ALWAYS do this before working on changes. This gets the most recent information from github, so you won't conflict with anyone else's changes.**
7. Comment "I will work on this" or something similar on a feature that was recommended in the [issues tab](https://github.com/WilliamsGDC/GDC-Platformer/issues), or describe your change in a new entry. Please be descriptive! 
8. If you are modifying a SCENE or PREFAB directly, create an entry here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ca5Iv3jNn5prLmtte_p4Kek2ZDbPyR-Vtkm9l6l553M/edit?usp=sharing. Once you are done, remove the entry. If someone is already modifying a scene that you want to modify, no worries! Create a copy of that scene and add your changes accordingly, they can be merged together later.
9. Make your changes!
10. Press "Commit to (branch name)" and keep pressing the blue box that shows up in the middle of the screen. It should eventually ask you to create a pull request.
11. Done!

In general, don't be afraid to refactor, just keep in mind that scenes and prefabs are REALLY HARD TO MERGE :(. Also try your best to regularly push & pull request, once per feature.
